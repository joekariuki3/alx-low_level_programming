Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free
The malloc function is used to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of a program. It will request a block of memory from the heap. If the request is granted, the operating system will reserve the requested amount of memory and malloc will return a pointer to the reserved space.

When the amount of memory is not needed anymore, you must return it to the operating system by calling the function free.

Automatic allocation
When you declare variables or when you use strings within double quotes, the program is taking care of all the memory allocation. You do not have to think about it.

julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ head -n 14 cisfun.c
/\*\*

- cisfun - function used for concept introduction
- @n1: number of projects
- @n2: number of tasks
-
- Return: nothing.
  */
  void cisfun(unsigned int n1, unsigned int n2)
  {
  int n;
  char c;
  int *ptr;
  char array[3];
  }
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$
  In the above example, the arguments and the local variables are stored automatically in memory when the function is called. The program reserves space and uses it without you having to think about it.

By default, the memory used to store those variables can be read and written. When the program leaves the function, the memory used for all the above variables is released for future use.

Special case: string literals

One special case we have seen so far is the memory used to store strings that we put within double quotes (") in our programs. For instance:

char \*str;

str = “ALX”;
The string "ALX" that was just declared is stored automatically in memory when the program is launched. But, the memory that stores the string is only readable. In fact, if you try to change a character using str, you will have a little surprise :)

julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ cat segf.c
/\*\*

- segf - Let's segfault \o/
-

  */
  void segf(void)
  {
  char *str;

      str = "ALX";
      str[0] = 's';

  }

/\*\*

  \*/
  int main(void)
  {
  segf();
  return (0);
  }
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ gcc segf.c
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ ./a.out
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$
  In the above example, the variable str is a pointer to a char, that is initialized to the address of the first character of the string “ALX”. But the memory storing the string “ALX” is read-only, and will also not be released when the function returns. This is the state of the memory after the line str = "ALX"; is executed (in red: read-only memory):

And this is the state of the memory after the function returns:

Note that when using the notation: char s[] = "ALX", the array s holds a copy of the string "ALX". So it is possible to modify this copy.

julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ cat print_school.c
#include <stdio.h>

/\*\*

- print_school - prints "ALX"
-
- Return: nothing.
  \*/
  void print_school(void)
  {
  char str[] = "ALX";

      str[0] = 's';
      printf("%s\n", str);

  }

/\*\*

  int main(void)

  return (0);
  }
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ gcc print_school.c
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ ./a.out
  solberton
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$
  This is the memory before the call to print_school:

Note that the string "ALX" is always present in the memory. We will see why later.

This is the memory right before the line str[0] = 's'; is executed:

Note the differences:

The variable str is not a pointer, it’s an array. str does not hold the memory address of the string "ALX", but a copy of it
The string “ALX” is copied into this array
And this is the memory state when the program leaves the function print_school:

Note, again, that the string "ALX" is still present in the memory.

Why would I need dynamic allocation?

So far we only have seen functions and programs that had fixed inputs. What happens when we do not know in advance how much memory you need and we will only know this at runtime, after compilation?

For instance, imagine we have to create a program that will store all the words contained in a file in an array. That file is passed as an argument to our program. There is no way we could know in advance how many words the file will contain. We can not declare a big array like char \*words[1024]; and assume that there will never be more than 1024 words in the file. That’s when malloc and friends come to the rescue, and will permit us to allocate dynamically the amount of memory we need.

Dynamic allocation
Malloc
The malloc function allocates a specific number of bytes in memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. This memory will have read and write permissions.

Prototype: void _malloc(size_t size);
where void _ means it is a pointer to the type of your choice
and size is the number of bytes your need to allocate
julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ cat malloc_example.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/\*\*

- main - introduction to malloc and free
-
- Return: 0.
  */
  int main(void)
  {
  char *str;

      str = malloc(sizeof(char) * 3);
      str[0] = 'O';
      str[1] = 'K';
      str[2] = '\0';
      printf("%s\n", str);
      return (0);

  }
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ gcc malloc_example.c -o m
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ ./m
  OK
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$
  In the above example we use malloc to create a 3 byte allocated space in memory, and we fill this space with characters. Note the use the operator sizeof. It is very important because as you know, the size of the different types will be different on different machines: we want 3 times the size of a char (which happens to be 3 times 1 byte on our 64-bit machine). Always use sizeof for a better portability.

Let’s see another example, with integers.

julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ cat malloc_example2.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/\*\*

- main - introduction to malloc and free
-
- Return: 0.
  */
  int main(void)
  {
  int *tab;

      tab = malloc(sizeof(*tab) * 3);
      tab[0] = 98;
      tab[1] = -1024;
      tab[2] = 402;
      printf("%d, %d, %d\n", tab[0], tab[1], tab[2]);
      return (0);

  }
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ gcc malloc_example2.c -o m2
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ ./m2
  98, -1024, 402
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$
  In the above example, we are using malloc to create a space in memory where we can store three integers. Again, by using sizeof instead of directly a number of bytes (12 for instance in this case if using a 64 bits machine) we are sure to get the right amount of memory, no matter what system we are compiling and running on.

memory

Contrary to local variables and function parameters, the memory that is allocated with malloc is not automatically released when the function returns.

julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ cat malloc_mem.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/\*\*

  */
  void m(int n0, int n1, int n2)
  {
  int *t;
  int sum;

      t = malloc(sizeof(*t) * 3);
      t[0] = n0;
      t[1] = n1;
      t[2] = n2;
      sum = t[0] + t[1] + t[2];
      printf("%d + %d + %d = %d\n", t[0], t[1], t[2], sum);

  }

/\*\*

  \*/
  int main(void)
  {
  m(98, 402, -1024);
  return (0);
  }
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$
  This is what the memory would look like before the function m returns:

And this will be the state of the memory after the function m returns:

The memory is not initialized

Just like with automatic allocation, the memory allocated by malloc is not initialized.

Free
When you are using malloc, you have to handle the memory yourself. This means that:

You need to keep track of all the addresses of the allocated memory (in a variable of type pointer)
You have to deallocate every memory space you previously allocated yourself. If you do not do this, then your program can run out of memory. Your operating system could even kill your program while it is running
julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ cat while_malloc.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/\*\*

- main - introduction to malloc and free
-
- Return: 0.
  _/
  int main(void)
  {
  while (1)
  {
  malloc(sizeof(char) _ 1024);
  }
  return (0);
  }
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ gcc while_malloc.c -o killme
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ ./killme
  Killed
  julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$

The free function frees the memory space which have been allocated by a previous call to malloc (or calloc, or realloc).

Prototype: void free(void \*ptr);
where ptr is the address of the memory space previously allocated by and returned by a call to malloc
Example:

julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ cat free_mem.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/\*\*

  */
  void m(int n0, int n1, int n2)
  {
  int *t;
  int sum;

      t = malloc(sizeof(*t) * 3);
      t[0] = n0;
      t[1] = n1;
      t[2] = n2;
      sum = t[0] + t[1] + t[2];
      printf("%d + %d + %d = %d\n", t[0], t[1], t[2], sum);
      free(t);

  }

/\*\*

- main - introduction to malloc and free
-
- Return: 0.
  \*/
  int main(void)
  {
  m(98, 402, -1024);
  return (0);
  }
  In the above example, the memory allocated by malloc is free‘d with a call to the function free.

You should always free all malloc'ed memory spaces.

Valgrind
When writing big and complex programs, it is not always easy to keep track of all allocated and deallocated memory. We can use the program Valgrind in order to ensure we are freeing all allocated memory. It is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.

julien@ubuntu:~/c/malloc$ cat malloc_mem.c

      t = malloc(sizeof(*t) * 3);
      t[0] = n0;
      t[1] = n1;
      t[2] = n2;
      sum = t[0] + t[1] + t[2];
      printf("%d + %d + %d = %d\n", t[0], t[1], t[2], sum);

  }

Don’t trust anyone
On error, malloc returns NULL. As for any other C library function, you should always check the malloc return value before using it. If you don’t you will run into segfaults.

  String literals and .rodata (advanced)
  The string literals are stored in your executable at compilation. The way it is stored is actually dependent on both the operating system you are using and the linker. This is what happens when you compile the program on most modern operating systems:

The compiler puts the string into a read-only data-section, usually .rodata
The linker collects all the data in such read-only sections and puts them into a single segment. This segment resides in the executable file and is flagged with a “read only”-attribute.
When you run the program, the operation system executable loader loads the executable (or maps it into memory to be more exact). Once this is done, the loader walks the sections and sets access-permissions for each segment. For a read-only data segment it will most likely disable code-execute and write access. Code (for example, your functions) gets execute rights but no write access. Ordinary data like static variables gets read and write access and so on…

One very easy way to check that the string literal is actually stored in your executable is to use the command strings (man strings).

String literals are not always read-only

On most modern operating system, string literals will be read-only. But this is (and certainly was) not always the case. It actually depends which operating system and linker you are using. For instance, if you were to compile segf.c for DOS, the program would not segfault. It would actually run because the memory where the string “ALX” would be stored would have write access. This would happen because the DOS loader does not know about read-only sections.

String literals are not always stored as strings in the executable

Note that we are using a 64-bit machine for the following example

So how does the program know what to print, without actually using the string? Well, sometimes (actually more often than you think), the compiler will optimize your code and modify it, without telling you. Let’s analyse what happens with objdump:

4005ad: 48 b8 48 6f 6c 62 65 movabs rax,0x6f747265626c6f48 is where the trick happens. The program moves the value 0x6f747265626c6f48 into the 64-bit register rax, and then copies this value on the stack, at the address where the array str is stored (4005b7: 48 89 45 e0 mov QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rax). Note that the value 0x6f747265626c6f48 takes 8 bytes in memory. As a result, this is what the memory looks like after the execution of mov QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rax:

Since str is an array of char, those bytes stored in str will be used as ASCII values of chars. Looking quickly at the ASCII table (man ascii), we can translate this into chars:

0x48 = 'H’
0x6f = ‘o’
0x6c = ‘l’
0x62 = ‘b’
0x65 = ‘e’
0x72 = ‘r’
0x74 = ‘t’
0x6f = ‘o’
This is the beginning of the string ALX! We are just missing two chars: n and \0. This is what the line 4005bb: 66 c7 45 e8 6e 00 mov WORD PTR [rbp-0x18],0x6e is taking care of:

0x6e is the ASCII value of the char n
mov WORD ensures that you actually moves 0x006e, as a WORD is two-byte long\*, and 0x00 is the ASCII code for the \0 char, that marks the end of a C string

- In this context, a WORD is 2-byte long, as we are referring to the Intel assembly language

After the execution of the line mov WORD PTR [rbp-0x18],0x6e, the memory looks like this:

And you have the complete string ALX stored in the array. In other words, it is possible that a string is stored as “code” and not as “data” in your executable.

HolbertoH

Note that if you look at the strings of the executable with strings you will find the string HolbertoH.

The way the program strings works: strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long and are followed by an unprintable character. It doesn’t know about sections and tries to interpret every bytes of the executable as a char. Therefore, as our executable contains the bytes 48 b8 48 6f 6c 62 65 72 74 6f, immediately followed by the bytes 48 89 45 e0,

4005ad: 48 b8 48 6f 6c 62 65 movabs rax,0x6f747265626c6f48
4005b4: 72 74 6f
4005b7: 48 89 45 e0 mov QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rax
strings recognizes Holberto (48 b8 48 6f 6c 62 65 72 74 6f), followed by an H (48) and followed by a non-printable char (89), and prints HolbertoH
