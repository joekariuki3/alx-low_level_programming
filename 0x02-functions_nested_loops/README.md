# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

Practice writing functions, using headers, and working with nested loops.

## Learning Objectives
- Define and call functions
- Create header files and use include guards
- Understand variable scope and prototypes
- Implement nested loops for patterns and computation

## Build
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o prog
```

## Run
```
./prog
```

## Notes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Place prototypes in a header (e.g., `main.h`)
