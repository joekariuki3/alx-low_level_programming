# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

Implement and analyze classic search algorithms.

## Learning Objectives
- Linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search
- Big O notation: time and space complexity
- Compare trade-offs and prerequisites (e.g., sorted arrays)

## Tips
- Always validate inputs and array bounds
- Print index steps only if the task requires it
